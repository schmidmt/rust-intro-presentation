	<h3>Design of Rust</h3>
	<h5>The compiler won't let you shoot yourself in the foot</h5> 
	<ul>
		<li class="fragment">
			Rust was designed to be fast, concurrent, and memory safe.
		</li>
		<li class="fragment">
			Basically, Rust wont let you do anything that breaks this design goal, unless explicitly stated.
		</li>
	</ul>

<section>
	Let's look at how Rust handles two examples which are likely to compile in other languages.
</section>

<section>
    In Rust, ownership of a section of memory is strictly enforced.
<pre>
<code class="rust hljs">
fn main() {
	let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
	let v2 = v;
	println!("{}", v[0]);
}
</code>
</pre>
</section>

<section>
    This fails to compile with
<pre>
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `v`
 --&gt; src/main.rs:6:20
4 |     let v2 = v;
  |         -- value moved here
5 |     
6 |     println!("{}", v[0]);
  |                    ^ value used here after move
  = note: move occurs because `v` has type `std::vec::Vec<i32>`,
    which does not implement the `Copy` trait

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.

<section>
	When sharing references, the referent must live longer than the reference.
<pre>
<code class="rust hljs">
fn main() {
	let y: &i32;
	{
		let x = 5;
		y = &x;
	}
	println!("{}", y);
}
</code>
</pre>

</section>
<section>
	This fails with the following:
<pre>
error[E0597]: `x` does not live long enough
 --&gt; src/main.rs:5:14
5 |         y = &amp;x;
  |              ^ borrowed value does not live long enough
6 |     }
  |     - `x` dropped here while still borrowed
7 |     println!("{}", y);
8 | }
  | - borrowed value needs to live until here
error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0597`.

This prevents issues like null-dereferencing.
