### Design of Rust 

<p class="fragment">
    Data is stored in structures or enumerations.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
    Rust implements a <strong>traits</strong> system, similar to type classes, to provide ad hoc polymorphism.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
    Traits are implemented on structs and enums giving a method like appearance.
</p>
<p class="fragment">
    Functions and Traits can be made generic, which look a lot like templates in C++.
</p>
